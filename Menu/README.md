menu.xml (Navigation Menu)
Menu Items: Defines clickable items (share, rate, privacy) with titles, IDs, and icons, which are inflated into the NavigationView for drawer display.
Icon Integration: Uses drawable resources (e.g., outline_arrow_outward_24) for visual cues, improving usability.
XML Structure: Follows Android's menu resource format, allowing dynamic population in NavigationView and easy handling in Java code via item IDs.
